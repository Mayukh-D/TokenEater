/// The provider marks.
///
/// Neither Anthropic nor OpenAI licenses its logo for this. Anthropic's
/// trademark guidelines permit their marks only in material they approve
/// beforehand, with no nominative carve-out, and OpenAI's brand kit forbids
/// anything that suggests endorsement. Using one official logo and not the
/// other would also break the symmetry the whole provider design rests on, so
/// the app draws its own.
///
/// One construction, not two logos: a 24-unit grid, a 9.6-unit outer radius, a
/// 2-unit stroke, round joins. What separates the providers is the order of
/// symmetry, eight for Claude's burst and six for OpenAI's rosette. A third
/// provider is another order on the same grid rather than a new asset to
/// negotiate.
///
/// Strokes rather than fills on purpose: these render small, and a filled
/// shape at 12 points loses its interior detail while a stroked one thins
/// evenly. The line width scales with the glyph and has a floor, the way SF
/// Symbols hold their optical weight.
///
/// Deliberately not SF Symbols. `sparkle` described a mood, and `terminal`
/// described Codex the CLI rather than OpenAI the provider.
